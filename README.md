- **Using slash command**
    - Run the slash command `/servicenow connect` in any channel.
    - You will get an ephemeral message from the ServiceNow bot containing a link to connect your account.
    - Click on that link. If it asks for login, enter your ServiceNow credentials and click `Allow` to authorize and connect your account.

- **Using the button in the right-hand sidebar**
    - Open the right-hand sidebar by clicking on the ServiceNow icon present in the channel header section of all channels.
    - You will see a button saying "Connect your account"

    - Click on that button. If it asks for login, enter your ServiceNow credentials and click `Allow` to authorize and connect your account.

After connecting successfully, you will get a direct message from the ServiceNow bot containing a Welcome message and some useful information along with some instructions for the system admins.
**Note**: You will only get a direct message from the bot if your Mattermost server is configured to allow direct messages between any users on the server. If your server is configured to allow direct messages only between two users of the same team, then you will not get any direct message.
